============================================================================

Learn Python using code examples that you can run!

Reading documentation is a good start to learn something new, but the real
learning starts by practicing and tinkering. That's the philosophy behind
this collection of examples. Each example is code that you can easily run so
that you can tinker with them. They are well documented and some even have
tests. New to Python? See more `recommended resources to learn Python`__.
